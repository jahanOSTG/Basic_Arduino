Arduino is a very small or pocket size microcontroller like computer. Arduino is an easy to use electronics platform that combines hardware and software. It includes microcontroller boards that you can program to control lights, motors, and sensors. 
Arduino boards come with different types of microprocessors and controllers. They have 
digital and analog input/output pins that can connect to expansion boards called "shields" 
or to breadboards for prototyping. This makes it easy to add new features or connect other 
circuits to your projects. Introduction of Arduino with basic information[Click Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VMVXcvuR_nhvPZryvdXfWVEkqHK-R4AU/view?usp=sharing)
